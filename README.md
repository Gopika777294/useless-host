### Project Description

Chaotic SnarkBot is a ridiculous chatbot that replies in an unserious, sarcastic tone with random emojis. It can detect distress in a message and temporarily switch to being wholesome and supportive.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Serious AI assistants are boring ‚Äî they either give you textbook answers or pretend to be your therapist. Where‚Äôs the chaos? Where‚Äôs the sarcasm?


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI chatbot that talks like it‚Äôs had too much coffee, sprinkles random emojis everywhere, and sometimes thinks it‚Äôs a potato. But if you seem sad, it drops the jokes and offers support.
